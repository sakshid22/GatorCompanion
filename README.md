# GatorCompanion
I created the Gator Companion website in order to assist in finding a travel companion. The main objective of this project is to implement the concepts of 'Human-Computer Interaction'. I conducted interviews with the age group of 15-30 years to record their expectations from a trip organizing website as a part of this project. Consequently, this website allows a user to organize short and big trips with strangers of similar interests. The website lets a user make a couple of travel choices from a pool of multiple options like desired destination, expected budget, preferred lodging, restricted meal plans, etc. In backhand, all the data entries are matched on a weighted scale according to preferred choices and as a result, users are notified with the rank list of suitable travel companions.
